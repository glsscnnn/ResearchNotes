    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans manually cateogrize and rely on expertise in order to classify MRI / PET / X-Ray scans this can pose an issue as Doctors can have an enormous amount of data to look over, and potential baises as well as fitigue could play a role in the classification process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past Doctors would use CAD systems, to assist them in this classification process. \"In the CAD systems, machine learning is able to extract informative features that describe the inherent patterns from data and play a vital role in medical image analysis\" (Zhang et al., 2020) \n",
    "\n",
    "**side note** I'm not entirely sure what this means, does it mean that we can use machine learning to extract features from CAD systems or does this mean that machine learning is built into those CAD systems? I would assume the former because in a previous paragraph they stated that these systems where around in the 1980s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem we seem to run into is that the brain is highly complex and feature selection in real life is still done by doctors today, this results in a problem for someone who would want to use machine learning to solve one of these problems as we are not experts this would be difficult for us to do proper feature selection there are some algorithms that exist out there but it's still somewhat limited according to the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "**side note** In data science this is usually the case that feature selection will be done by a human regardless of the domain this is why we need to understand more about the particular subject that we are doing research on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Compared to the traditional machine learning algorithms, deep learning automatically discovers the informative representations without the professional knowledge of domain experts\" (Zhang et al., 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "**side note** So in our approach this would be really inefficent this is talking about unsupervised learning, in the case of unsupervised learning although it can discover features by itself without humans it takes a lot more time and a lot more data than a supervised learning method. From what I understand \"Deep Learning\" doesn't mean that it has to be unsupervised \"Deep Learning\" is just a classification of learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "It says that we can break down medical image analysis into several categories: classification, detection, registration, and segmentation. Classification aims to classify images into two or more categories \"the stacked auto-encoder model\" is an example of this classification. Detection consists of finding where the problem lies if there's a tumor for example the ability to identify where the tumor is. Segmentation is taking medical images and partitioning them into relevant parts i.e. tissue classes, organs etc. \"Registration of medical images is a process that searches for the correct alignment of images.\" (Zhang et al., 2020). *Not entirely sure what this means by \"alignment\".*\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there's also some other tasks that you can do such as content-based image retreival, image generation and image enhancement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the paper will be structured as follow **TODO add table of contents**:\n",
    "    - popular deep learning techniques for brain disorders\n",
    "    - detailed overview of recent studies"
